Scrape brawl stars power league games played 

Brawl Stars only records the most recent 20 games played. We want to record down games for future analysis and to improve our pick/ban decisions. 

This script will run request for recently played games from the Brawl API and record it onto Google Sheets. A cronjob is set up to run this script periodically before games are lost when exceeding the 20 game limit.
